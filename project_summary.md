# Food Waste Project Summary

## Introduction and Motivation
In a world where food security remains a pressing global concern, the issue of food waste has emerged as a critical and interconnected challenge. To begin an exploration to examine what are the causes and effects of food waste globally, I chose to examine food waste in the context of the different countries in the world and their unique factors.

## Methods
I merged two publically available data sets to obtain the final data set.

## Results
Only a few of the factors that compared from the different countries appeared to have a significant effect on food waste per capita. GDP appears to have a slight negative relationship with total food waste, and population density has a slight positive relationship with food waste. The most interesting result was the fact that retail had much lower variance (with the exception of a few outliers) than household food waste. Household food waste also has a much larger impact on total food waste across the board.

## Conclusion
The data shows that there are some relationships between these country statistcis and food waste, but more analysis with more variable is needed. This analysis does show that focusing on finding ways to reduce household food waste would help the most to reduce overall food waste.
